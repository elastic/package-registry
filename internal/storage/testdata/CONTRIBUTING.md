The latest version of the `search-index-all.json` file can be downloaded from Internal CI,
from [indexing job](https://buildkite.com/elastic/package-storage-infra-indexing/builds?branch=main). Indices are
stored as build artifacts. These are the same files as ones stored in the production Google Cloud bucket.
