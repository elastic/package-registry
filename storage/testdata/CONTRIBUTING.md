The latest version of the `search-index-all-1.json` file can be downloaded from Internal CI,
from [indexing job](https://internal-ci.elastic.co/job/package_storage/job/indexing-job/job/main/). Indices are
additionally stored as build artifacts. These are the same files as ones stored in the production Google Cloud bucket.
